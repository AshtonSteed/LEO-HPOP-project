#TODO: A drag class that uses NRLMSIS to calculate drag from date/10.7 and location
#Maybe use pymsis, library to calculate NRLMSIS data from inputs. 
# Using pymsis, make a large datatable for density over desired time period

#Also, Drag depends on ramming velocity, which is satV - atmV.
#Angular velocity of atm is near constant, but has some variation which might need considering.
